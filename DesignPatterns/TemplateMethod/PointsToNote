Superclass calls the methods in the subclasses.
Methods in base class with default implementation are referred as Hooks and
they are intended to be overridden by subclasses,
if you want some of the methods to be not overridden, you can make them final,
for example in our case we can make buildFoundation() method final because
if we donâ€™t want subclasses to override it.
